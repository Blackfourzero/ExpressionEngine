# ExpressionEngine Changelog

ExpressionEngine uses semantic versioning. This file contains changes to ExpressionEngine since the last Build / Version release for PATCH version changes only.

## Patch Release

Bullet list below, e.g.
   - Adds validation for pages URIs without a selected template
   - Adding `is_system_on` setting caching, so updating does not alter whether the system is on after updating or bailing
   - Fixes variable type notices



EOF MARKER: This line helps prevent merge conflicts when things are
added on the bottoms of lists
