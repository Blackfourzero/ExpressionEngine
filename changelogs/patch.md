# ExpressionEngine Changelog

ExpressionEngine uses semantic versioning. This file contains changes to ExpressionEngine since the last Build / Version release for PATCH version changes only.

## Patch Release

Bullet list below, e.g.
   - Adds PHP7.4 support
   - Adds validation for pages URIs without a selected template
   - Adding `is_system_on` setting caching, so updating does not alter whether the system is on after updating or bailing
   - Fixes variable type notices
   - Added default to same page for consent return
   - Fixes bug where `after_channel_entry_save` hook would run twice.
   - Ignores url_title in fetch param function, for issues related to URL titles called `n`
